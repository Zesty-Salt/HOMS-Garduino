`Changing Settings`\
For standard users, please only exit code after line ##.

`Understanding Code`\
I have attempted to lable each and every line of code to explain what the line/block of code is responsible for.

Example:
~~~cpp
// Print the message "Hello!" onto the serial monitor
Serial.println("Hello!");
~~~
If you still need further explination, try searching the  [Arduino Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)

`Work In Progress`\
